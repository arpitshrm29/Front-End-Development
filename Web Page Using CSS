The Lightning Arrester has one terminal that is designed to handle very high voltage and another terminal connected to the ground .
Lightning Arrester are not the same thing as Lightning rods . Lightning rods are used to protect entire buildings and other structures from lightning damage . They are placed with the goal of getting lightning to strike the rod first and dissipate out through a grounding case . 

2.1 WORKING PRINCIPLE OF LIGHTNING ARRESTER 
The earthing screen and ground wires can well protect the electrical system  against   the  direct  lightning  strokes   but  they  fail   to   provide protection against travelling waves , which may reach the terminal apparatus .The Lightning Arrester or surge diverts provide protection against such surges . A Lightning Arrester or a surge diverted is a protective device ,  which conducts the high voltage surges on power system to the ground .
It consists of a spark gap in series with a non-linear resistor  . One end of the diverter is connected to the terminal of the equipment to be protected and the other end is effectively grounded .
The length of the gap is so set that normal voltage is not enough to cause an arc but a dangerously high voltage will break down the air insulation and form an arc .The property of the non-linear resistance is that its resistance increases as voltage ( or current ) increases and vice-versa .

2.2 ADVANTAGE OF LIGHTNING ARRESTER   
•	They are not very expensive .
•	They are improved formof rod gap arresters as they block the flow of power frequency follow currents .
•	They can be easily installed .

2.3 LIMITATIONS 
•	An expulsion type arrester can perform only limited number of operations as during each operation some of the fiber materials is used up .
•	This type of arrester cannot be mounted on enclosed equipment due to discharge of gases during operation .
•	Due to the poor volt/am characteristic of the arrester , it is not suitable for protection of expensive equipment .

2.4 MAINTENANCE OF LIGHTNING ARRESTERS
•	Cleaning the outside of the arrester housing .
•	The line should be de-energized before handling the arrester .
•	The earth connection should be checked periodically .
•	To record the readings of the surge counter .
•	The line lead is securely fastened to the line conductor and arrester 
•	The ground lead is securely fastened to the arrester terminal and ground .
